# Tailwind CSS Content Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied due to an incorrect configuration of the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js`.

The `bug.js` file shows the initial incorrect configuration, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

## Bug
The problem lies in the paths specified within the `content` array of `tailwind.config.js`.  The incorrect paths might prevent Tailwind from correctly scanning and processing your project's files.

## Solution
Correctly specifying the file paths in the `content` array is crucial. The solution involves ensuring that the paths accurately reflect the location of your components and templates that use Tailwind classes.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Attempt to use Tailwind classes in a component.
4. Observe that the styles are not applied (using the `bug.js` file). 
5. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js`. 
6. Observe that the styles are now correctly applied.
